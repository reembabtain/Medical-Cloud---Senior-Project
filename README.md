# Medical-Cloud---Senior-Project

The objective of this project is to collect the patient information from scattered healthcare providers and hospitals into one unified record, which indeed can facilitate its accessibility for both the patients and the authorized medical staff to check and update the record as needed. Therefore, we designed a novel secure community cloud contains patient health record. Placing the patient health record in one place can improve health care delivery by providing medical personnel with better access, higher quality, and faster data retrieval.
